# SPK - trajectory kernels
  1. jup????.bsp - Trajectories of the moons
     of Jupiter. Should use the version that
     corresponds to the Voyager trajectory
     to be used.
  2. sat????.bsp - Trajectories of the moons
     of Saturn. Same caveat for versions.
  3. vgr1_jup230.bsp - trajectory consistent
     with jup230.bsp
  4. nep081.bsp - 801 Triton, 802 Neried, 
     808 Proteus (N1), documented in [Jacobson 2009](http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/0004-6256/137/5/4322)
  5. vgr2_nep081.bsp - Voyager trajectory consistent with nep081.
     Documented as being an update to nep076 solution, which
     itself is documented in [Jacobson 2008](https://doi.org/10.2514/6.2008-7372)
  6. nep095.bsp - Triton, Neried, 803 Naiad (N6),
     804 Thalassa (N5), 805 Despina (N3), 806 Galatea (N4),
     807 Larissa (N2), Proteus.
  7. nep097.bsp - Triton. Documented in [Brozovic 2022](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.icarus.2019.113462)
  8. vgr2_nep097.bsp - Documented in Brozovic 2022 

Note -- for the super-trajectories, there are
newer versions on the NAIF web site, but the
comments in those kernels specifically say
that they are regressions to the versions
included here.
