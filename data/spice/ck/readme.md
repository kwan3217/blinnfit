# CK - pointing kernels
  1. [V1SAT_VERSION5_TYPE3_MERGED_CSMITHED.ck](https://pds-rings.seti.org/voyager/ck/)
    This is a "C-smithed" kernel, with the 
    camera pointing of the narrow angle camera
    from its original experiment data record (SEDR)
    tapes, and corrected such that the stars,
    planets, and moons, are where they are
    in the actual images.
  2. [vg[12]_(jup|sat)_qmw_[nw]a.bc](https://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/VOYAGER/kernels/ck/)
    These are pointing kernels directly
    translated from the SEDR tapes, only 
    valid at each camera exposure. These are
    equivalent to the "Version 1" kernels from
    i above
  3. vg1_jup_version1_type1_iss_sedr.bc This
    is from the same page as the c-smithed
    kernel in the first reference
  4. vgr[12]_super.bc, from same source as ii
     above. This is the orientation of the
     spacecraft body over the whole mission,
     constructed from spacecraft SEDR tapes.
